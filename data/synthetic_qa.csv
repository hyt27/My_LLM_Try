ep1_20231516.pdf,Excavation Support Systems in Hong Kong,Intermediate,"What advancements have been made in the knowledge, technology, and modern methods for designing and executing excavation and lateral support works since the publication of GCO Publication No. 1/90?","Since the publication of GCO Publication No. 1/90, there have been many advances in the knowledge, technology, and modern methods for designing and executing excavation and lateral support works. The Working Group on Revision of GCO Publication No. 1/90 was set up to update the publication and consolidate local practice and experience in the construction of ELS works in Hong Kong.","Deep excavations are common in the urban area of Hong Kong and often adopted for construction of multi-level basements, railway and road tunnels. Excavation in such environments invariably presents challenges to planners, engineers and contractors, as there are always nearby buildings, structures and services to be protected. The consequences of any excavation collapse could be serious and costly. For this reason, excavation in soil generally requires sufficient lateral support to minimise any adverse effect on the surrounding environment. The GCO Publication No. 1/90 Review of Design Methods for Excavations (GEO, 1990) gave the then state-of-the-art methods for the design of excavation support systems, as well as the prediction of ground deformation around excavations. Since then, there have been many advances in the knowledge, technology and modern methods for designing and executing excavation and lateral support works. In view of these developments, a Working Group on Revision of GCO Publication No. 1/90 was set up to update the publication. The purpose of this document is to give guidance for the design and construction of ELS works in Hong Kong, taking cognizance of latest advancements in pertinent subjects. This document also consolidates local practice and experience in the construction of ELS works in Hong Kong and provides recommendations for mitigating the geotechnical risks associated with excavations. The publication is intended for use by readers who have some general knowledge of ELS works.",Excellent,Excellent,Non-Toxic,Unbiased,Fully Grounded
