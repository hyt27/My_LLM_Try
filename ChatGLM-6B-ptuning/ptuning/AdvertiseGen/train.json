{"prompt": "What is the role of steel lagging in soldier pile walls?","response": "Steel lagging is used to support the soil face and prevent deterioration of the soil arching effect between the piles in soldier pile walls. It is installed in lifts of 1.0 m to 1.5 m depending on soil strength and groundwater conditions."}
{"prompt": "What is the typical horizontal spacing between steel struts used in bottom-up construction in Hong Kong?","response": "The typical horizontal spacing between steel struts used in bottom-up construction in Hong Kong is between 3 m and 9 m."}
{"prompt": "What are the advantages of using hydromills over grabs for excavating rectangular trenches?","response": "Hydromills are generally more powerful, efficient, and versatile than grabs for excavating rectangular trenches. They can work continuously to lift the excavated material to the surface, while grabs require manual emptying. Hydromills are also capable of handling harder materials and can excavate deeper trenches."}
{"prompt": "What challenges arise when installing sheet piles through dense soils?","response": "Installation of sheet piles through dense soils (e.g. SPT 'N' values larger than 30) can be difficult using the vibration method. Vibration may induce ground settlement and damage the pile interlocks, especially in loose sandy soils or rock fills. For very dense soils with SPT 'N' values up to 120, a hydraulic or drop hammer may be used instead. Hard driving of sheet piles through obstructions should be avoided to ensure water tightness."}
{"prompt": "How does hoop compression improve water tightness between diaphragm wall panels?","response": "Hoop compression, a phenomenon where the wall panels themselves act as compression members to resist the lateral earth load, can improve water tightness between diaphragm wall panels by creating a continuous seal and reducing the potential for leakage."}
